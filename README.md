# Zee's "Probes Before Crew" CTT Overhaul
*KSP Version 1.8 - 1.12+*

> Adopted by Flore (@Moonlington)

[Original Forum Post by _Zee](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/181013-ksp-18-112-probes-before-crew-pbc-version-293/)

## The Highlights
- Generally speaking, all tech categories were stretched out a bit to enjoy all the new leg-room the CTT gives us.
- Probe Cores come first, and now possess their own form of crew report, the 'Telemetry Report'. Cockpits don't show up until T4, and Command Modules must wait until T5.
- A purpose-built, completely optional Contract Pack by Zee that overhauls the economy of the game and aims to make it more challenging.
- Antenna, Electrical, Science, Utilities, Thermals, ISRU, etc;  they have all been re-positioned [and in some cases mildly tweaked] with careful consideration of one another.
- Science Overhauled and Re-balanced; Experiments are less tedious, more spread out across the tech tree branches, and place higher significance/reward on the experiments that REQUIRE a Kerbal be present.
- Celestial Body Science Multipliers have been re-scaled so that your career no longer feels finished by the time you reach Duna. 
  - **PLEASE NOTE: Science rewards have been reduced overall. It is not recommended you set the Science slider below 70%, and that's under the assumption you are at least using DMagic Orbital Science (If not, consider moving the slider higher).**

**This chart <ins>is not</ins> an exhaustive list of all the vanilla parts that have been moved, it just highlights the big players and gives you a general idea of their new relationship to each other.**

**This chart serves as the guideline/reference point for mod support patches as they are added.**

## Supported Mods
"Supported" Mod means that every part, science definition, and entry/VAB cost for that mod have been adjusted and placed in a way as to be consistent with all other supported mods.

This means a unified, intuitive, and logical experience as you progress through the tech tree with all your favorite mods.

If you **use mods not listed** it's completely fine, they just *might* unlock at odd times relative to the rest of PBC.

If there are **mods listed that you don't use**, no worries! This mod ignores making changes to mods you don't have, and none of them are required.

## Original Built-For-PBC Contract Pack
![Original Built-For-PBC Contract Pack](https://i.ibb.co/vvk05yTC/Contracts-Map-V9.png)

**If you choose to use the PBC contract pack, quick facts you should know:**

-   All you need to do to "enable it" is [install Contract Configurator by Nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-16x-contract-configurator-v1271-2018-12-28/). That's it! (Contract Configurator comes with the CKAN installation.)
    -   Another mod by Nightingale, [Strategia](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131808-15x-strategia-v173-2018-12-12/&tab=comments#comment-2402496) pairs very well with this contract pack. Highly recommended.
-   This contract pack is purpose built for this techtree, so it is not being released as a separate mod and no support is offered if you try to use it without PBC.
-   The vanilla tutorial and exploration contracts are disabled when running PBC Contracts. Mini-milestones will provide smaller rewards. They will no longer shower us with easy money in the early game! 
-   Any vessel you land on a given body that meets all pre-reqs will be a valid candidate vessel to complete the "Return Home" parameter; leaving you to do so at your own pace with any valid vessel you want.
    -   **PLEASE NOTE: Just like the notice above about Science, It is recommended you keep your funds slider *at least* at 80% if using PBC Contracts. The economy has been overhauled and made much more challenging.\
You will feel the difference between 100% > 90% > 80%.**
